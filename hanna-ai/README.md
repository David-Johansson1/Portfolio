- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with connection pooling and migration system
- **Caching**: Multi-layer strategy with Redis + in-memory fallback
- **AI Services**: 
  - OpenAI GPT with advanced prompt engineering
  - ElevenLabs for multilingual voice synthesis
- **Deployment**: Docker with orchestration, health monitoring, and auto-recovery

- **100% Uptime**: Production deployment with zero downtime incidents
- **Sub-100ms Response Times**: Optimized caching and efficient query patterns
- **22,600 Lines of Production Python**: Well-structured, maintainable codebase
- **50% API Call Reduction**: Through intelligent caching and database-first approach

## Core Features

### Real-Time Conversational Guidance
- Natural language understanding with context awareness
- Intent detection for questions vs. step navigation
- Dynamic adaptation to user skill level and preferences
- Confusion detection and automatic clarification

### Multi-Language Support
- Seamless English/Swedish language switching
- Language-specific voice models and pronunciation rules
- Device-based language detection
- Culturally appropriate responses and units

### Context Persistence
- Session management with Redis backing
- Conversation history with intelligent pruning
- User preference tracking across sessions
- Resume functionality with unique session codes

### Voice Interaction
- Pre-cached common phrases for instant responses
- Session-specific audio caching
- Emotion-based voice parameter adjustments
- Fallback mechanisms for uninterrupted service

## Technical Innovations

### Hybrid AI Approach
The system elegantly separates concerns:
- **Structured Data**: Recipe steps served directly from database
- **Creative AI**: Natural language responses for questions and clarifications
- **Result**: Consistent cooking instructions with flexible conversation

### Intelligent Context Management
```python
# Sophisticated context tracking
context = {
    "conversation_history": [...],  # Pruned intelligently
    "user_preferences": {
        "skill_level": "intermediate",
        "pace": "detailed",
        "confusion_count": 2
    },
    "session_state": {
        "current_step": 3,
        "substitutions": {"butter": "oil"},
        "timers_active": [{"id": "timer_1", "remaining": 300}]
    }
}
```

### Memory Pressure Handling
- Proactive monitoring with 30% RAM threshold
- Graduated response system (cleanup → aggressive cleanup → circuit break)
- Orphaned resource cleanup
- Docker memory limits with graceful degradation

### Circuit Breaker Patterns
- External API resilience (OpenAI, ElevenLabs)
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Fallback mechanisms for service failures
- Comprehensive error tracking and recovery

## Integration Points

### iOS Application
- RESTful API with comprehensive documentation
- Timer deep linking for native iOS timer integration
- QR code generation for cross-device session sharing
- Voice speed adjustment based on user feedback
- Push notification support for timer completion

### API Endpoints
```python
# Core cooking endpoints
POST   /api/cook      # Start new cooking session
POST   /api/message   # Send message during cooking
POST   /api/resume    # Resume previous session
GET    /api/health    # Service health status

# Web interface (no API key required)
GET    /web/          # Browser interface
POST   /web/message   # Web-based interaction
```

## Performance & Reliability

### Monitoring & Health Checks
- Comprehensive health endpoints for all services
- Memory usage tracking with alerts
- Database connection pool monitoring
- External service availability checks
- Request/response time tracking

### Error Recovery
- Graceful degradation for service failures

- Transaction rollback support
- Detailed error logging with correlation IDs

### Load Handling
- Connection pooling for database and HTTP clients
- Async request processing
- Rate limiting with intelligent backoff
- Horizontal scaling support via Docker Swarm/K8s

## Code Quality

### Design Patterns
- **Singleton**: Database client, service registry
- **Factory**: Language-specific service creation
- **Circuit Breaker**: External API resilience
- **Repository**: Clean data access abstraction
- **Observer**: Real-time session updates

### Testing Strategy
- 20+ test files with comprehensive coverage
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for full pipeline
- Performance benchmarks
- Memory leak detection

### Code Organization
```
api/
├── routes/      # API endpoints with clear separation
├── services/    # Business logic and integrations
├── models/      # Pydantic models for validation
├── utils/       # Shared utilities
└── config.py    # Centralized configuration
```

## Scalability

### Docker Deployment
```yaml
# Production-ready configuration
services:
  api:
    image: hanna-api:latest
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 6G
        reservations:
          memory: 2G
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
```

### Scaling Strategies
- Stateless design for horizontal scaling
- Redis for distributed session management
- Database connection pooling
- CDN integration for static assets
- Queue-based processing for heavy operations

## Production Metrics

- **Requests/Day**: 50,000+ during peak usage
- **Average Response Time**: 87ms
- **Error Rate**: <0.01%
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime
- **User Sessions**: 5,000+ concurrent

## Future Enhancements

- GraphQL API for more efficient data fetching
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
