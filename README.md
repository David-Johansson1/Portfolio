# David Johansson - Portfolio

> **A Note on My Contribution History:** A significant portion of my coding activity from the past year, particularly during the intensive 6-month development of the RecipeBud ecosystem, can be found on my legacy account: **[howudoin123](https://github.com/howudoin123)**. I have since transitioned to this professional profile for all future work.
